Twitter Bootstrap Extension for Yii 2
=====================================

The extension includes support for the [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) markup and components framework
(also known as "Twitter Bootstrap"). Bootstrap is an excellent, responsive framework that can greatly speed up the
client-side of your development process.

The core of Bootstrap is represented by two parts:

- CSS basics, such as a grid layout system, typography, helper classes, and responsive utilities.
- Ready to use components, such as forms, menus, pagination, modal boxes, tabs etc.
